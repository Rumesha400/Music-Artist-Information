            <p class="table-dark">About:</p>
            When Green Day's Dookie broke through in early 1994, rock was still dominated by bands like Nirvana 
            and Pearl Jam: brooding, serious, hostile to pop. Though originally hailed as punk revivalists 
            blindsiding the mainstream from the margins Green Day has become one of rock's sturdiest institutions, 
            a band whose sound threads the three-chords-and-a-head-rush excitement that runs through everything 
            from 50s rockabilly and 60s garage to 80s New Wave and 90s skate-punk.
            Formed in the late '80s in San Francisco's East Bay, the band 
            (singer/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist Mike Dirnt, and drummer Tré Cool, the latter of whom 
            replaced John Kiffmeyer early on) became one of the preeminent forces in '90s and '00s rock, joining 
            a wave of artists

            <p class="table-dark">About:</p>
            Avril Lavigne's sharp, punk-informed pop can mean everything to any girl who's ever felt like an 
            outsider. Born in Ontario, Canada, in 1984. with the release of her 2002 debut album, Let Go, 
            Lavigne didn't just go against that glossy image, she shattered it, 
            spiking her hooks with sass and sincerity and making loose neckties and a tank top a must-have 
            fashion statement. The young spitfire faced love with intimidating confidence—she not only fell for 
            the “Sk8er Boi,” she wrote songs with him—and approached poseurs with eye-rolling distaste, as 
            expressed on her breakout single “Complicated.” Moving on from her teens, Lavigne's kept that youthful 
            spirit and outspoken edge alive, empowering girls to stand up for themselves 
            (2004's post-grunge earworm “Don't Tell Me”), maybe steal a boy or two in the process 
            (2007's bubbly pop-punk anthem “Girlfriend”), and never, ever lose touch with their wild side 
            (2013's punky sing-along “Here's to Never Growing Up”). 
            She's continually reinvented herself, too, moving effortlessly between romantic balladeer, 
            stadium-rock warrior, and a “bombshell raisin' hell”—while baring all, even through public breakups 
            and an enduring battle with Lyme disease. It's been enough to keep Lavigne in the spotlight

            <p class="table-dark">About:</p>
            Armed with energetic riffs and a violin player, Yellowcard catapulted into the spotlight during the 
            early 2000s and remained one of pop-punk's biggest acts for more than a decade.
            Yellowcard started out in 1997 as a hardcore band but shifted toward pop-punk once Ryan Key became 
            the group's lead singer a couple of years later.Following several independent releases, their 2003 major-label debut, Ocean Avenue, reached No. 23 on the Billboard 200 and was certified Platinum.
            In 2005, the band performed a cover of Simple Minds' hit “Don't You (Forget About Me)” 
            during the MTV Movie Awards as part of a tribute to the film The Breakfast Club.
            Beginning with 2007's Paper Walls LP, they landed six straight LPs in the Top 10 of Billboard's 
            Alternative Albums chart.

            <p style="text-justify:justify;">
            <p class="table-dark">About:</p>
            In the 2000s, My Chemical Romance became leaders of emo's third wave by combining goth-leaning 
            rock 'n' roll with dark, comic-book-inspired storytelling. Formed by vocalist Gerard Way in the wake 
            of the September 11 terrorist attacks—his song "Skylines and Turnstiles" is a direct response to the 
            tragedy—the Newark, New Jersey band cut their teeth locally, building a loyal online fanbase with 
            their first album, 2002's I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love. The group—which also 
            includes guitarists Ray Toro and Frank Iero, and Way's brother Mikey on bass—charged their way into 
            the mainstream with the singles “I'm Not Okay (I Promise)” and “Helena” from their 2004 major-label 
            debut, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. It was 2006's multiplatinum-certified The Black Parade, 
            a rock opera indebted to Queen and David Bowie, that cemented the quintet as ambitious conceptual 
            artists. On the subsequent world tour, the band wore black marching-band uniforms and used dramatic 
            stage flourishes—for example, the shows began with Gerard Way rolled onto the stage in a hospital 
            bed—for theatrical effect. Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys followed in 2010 
            with a dystopian plotline and nods to Britpop, New Wave, and stomping glam. MCR split in 2013, 
            but their celebrated 2019 reunion confirmed what longtime fans already suspected: Their music 
            continues to resonate with younger generations.
