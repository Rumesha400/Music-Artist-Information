            <p class="table-dark">About:</p>
            Armed with just a ukulele and acoustic guitar, Punjabi singer-songwriter Anuv Jain adds natural
            warmth to melancholy yet reassuring tracks that have helped him become one of India's top
            independent artists.
            In 2012 at the age of 17, he wrote and uploaded a demo version of “Baarishein”, his twinkling
            debut single. He later rerecorded it for official release in 2018.
            When he was 17, he also wrote the stirring, powerful song “Maula”—written from the perspective
            of his twin sister—when their father sadly passed away. It was officially released in 2020.
            Despite Jain's songs of heartbreak, he also pens happier cuts like “Mishri” and English-language 
            numbers such as 2018's ukulele-strummed “Ocean”.
