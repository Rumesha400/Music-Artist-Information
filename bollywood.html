                    Aslam is best-known for his prolific work as a playback singer, 
                    recording vocals for tracks that Bollywood actors then lip sync to onscreen.

                    financed the recording of their hit single “Aadat”.
                    The success of “Aadat” drew the attention of Bollywood director Mahesh Bhatt, 
                    who asked Aslam to record a track for the film Zeher.
